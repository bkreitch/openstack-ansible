# fix
# When using lvm as a manila backend its advised to run manila-volumes on metal.
# If you are using a different backend you may want to remove "is_metal: true".
# Otherwise if manila-volumes is already running in containers you may want to
# leave is_metal off, alternatively you will have to migrate your volumes once
# deployed on metal.
